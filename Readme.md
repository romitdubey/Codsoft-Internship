# Codsoft Internship Repository

Welcome to the Codsoft Internship repository! In this repository, you will find Jupyter Notebooks for three different predictive analysis projects: Titanic Survival Prediction, Sales Prediction, and Credit Card Prediction. These notebooks are part of the internship program conducted by Codsoft, where we explore various machine learning techniques to predict outcomes in different domains.

## Project Descriptions

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

The Titanic Survival Prediction project focuses on predicting whether a passenger survived or not based on the given dataset containing information about Titanic passengers. We use machine learning algorithms to analyze factors such as age, gender, class, etc., to determine the likelihood of survival during the infamous Titanic disaster.

### 2. Sales Prediction

The Sales Prediction project deals with predicting future sales for a company based on historical sales data. We utilize time series forecasting techniques and machine learning models to forecast sales, helping businesses make informed decisions and plan their inventory accordingly.

### 3. Credit Card Prediction

The Credit Card Prediction project revolves around predicting credit card fraud based on historical credit card transaction data. By employing various machine learning algorithms and anomaly detection techniques, we aim to identify fraudulent activities in credit card transactions and provide insights to financial institutions for enhanced security measures.


## Usage

To explore and run the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed in your local environment. If you don't have it already, you can install it via Anaconda or pip.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/romitdubey/Codsoft-Internship.git`


2. Launch Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the cloned repository's folder.

3. Open any of the three Jupyter Notebooks (`titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb`, `sales_prediction.ipynb`, or `credit_card_Fraud.ipynb`) to explore the respective project.

4. Follow the instructions and run the cells in the notebook to observe the analysis, visualizations, and predictions.

## Contributions

We appreciate contributions to this repository. If you find any bugs, have improvements, or want to add more projects to the internship program, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.

Happy coding and exploring the world of predictive analysis!
